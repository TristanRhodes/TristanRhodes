## About

I'm Tristan, a solid principle engineer with broad exposure to a wide range of business practices. I bring over 15 years of experience in application design, distributed systems, problems of scale, and data modeling. 

I have lead teams composed of local and remote engineers that have handled the design, implementation and ongoing maintenance of distributed systems, key algorithms and business critical infrastructure. 

This is my blog. There are many like it. This one is mine.
