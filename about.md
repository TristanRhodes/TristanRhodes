## About

I'm Tristan, a solid principle engineer with broad experience in product and business strategy, who works across businesses to identify, define and deliver clean, efficient solutions that solve real world needs. 

I've got over a decade of experience leading teams both local and remote, on a variety of large and small systems and have run teams that handled the design, implementation and ongoing maintenance of distributed systems, key algorithms and business critical infrastructure. 

This is my blog. There are many like it. This one is mine.
