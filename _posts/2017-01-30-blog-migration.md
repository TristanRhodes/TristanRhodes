## To Jekyll!
Alright! The blog is migrated to Jekyll. It's been a long time coming, (Mostly me hacking at the style until it looked right) and it feels good to have it done :)

## The Why
Originally my blog was done using [MicroBlog](https://github.com/madskristensen/MiniBlog). I never made any posts.... the content never felt very portable, or easy to manage.

I discovered Jekyll by way of starting Ve's company blog with a couple of web guys. It gave us the ability to combine branch management using git, with a VSO / Octopus deployment pipeline. While this may not be for everyone, I found it fit in really well with my style of working; pull requests for articles being merged into the main project, and staging used for editorial review before going live.

## Credits
I'd like to thank Bartoz, Florian, and Ve Interactive for the basic paged jeckll paging blog implementation that I stripped down and re-styled.
