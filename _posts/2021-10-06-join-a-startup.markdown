## It'll be fun... they said

I looked at my blog recently, and realised that 

1. HTTPS was now enforced and the SSL certificate was broken so anyone going to it got a security warning, and... 
2. the style and content was terrible and hadn't been updated in 5 years. 

This is what happens when you join a startup, it consumes your life with fascinating problems that stop you thinking about anything else. (And you can't write about them because it's all internal IP)

And to be fair, it has been a lot of fun, and...

- [x] Chaotic
- [x] Fast Paced
- [x] Technically Demanding
- [x] Rapidly Changing Environment
- [x] Projects of _all_ kinds
- [x] Full of fascinating problems (Maybe that's just the mobility domain)
