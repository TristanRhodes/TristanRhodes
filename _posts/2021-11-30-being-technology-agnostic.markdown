## Technology

Lorem Ipsum...

### What do we do?
I have a driving licence. I have a car I know very well. My trusty Renault Clio (ULEZ Exempt Baby!) is the car I have the most experience in. So when I go applying for my next job as a Hermes driver, I'll make sure everyone knows I'm fully qualified in Renault Clios.

But that's not really how transferable knowledge works. I don't need to specify I have driven a given type of car to get a job driving a car of that type. My skills are transferable, as long as I understand the mechanics of an Automobile, there are only a few variables.

I can explain that I have experience in left hand and right hand drive, as well as manual and automatic. But I don't list all the cars I have this on, and a new car would not cause me any difficulties.

Pedants: Yes, there are different vehicle types. Go with the analogy. :P

### Nodes
* CPU
* Physical Computer
* VM
* Process
* Lambda
* 


### Communication
Communication in computer terms is a concept that is split between transport (what delivery mechanism the data is sent by) protocol (what the message envelope is, eg udp, tcp, http) and format (what the payload being sent looks like). With these together, we can encapsulate the idea of communication, and abstract it away to be anything.

LAN / WAN
PCI Bus

TCP, UDP

Http, 


### Queues

The same goes for Message Queues. There are a couple of variables:
* At least once vs at most once delivery?
* Single or multi node?
* Resilient or transient?
* Does it support seeking?
* Does the queue have temporal elements? i.e. deferred execution.

But these are all features of a queue, we don't really care what queue we use, as long as the features of the queue match up with what we need.

### Caching
* Caching on chip (CPU/GPU)
* Caching in ram (RAM, GRAM)
* Caching in process (MemCache)
* Caching remote (Redis)
* Caching on the client (React)
