## Toolchain

This is a list of services, software, packages and images that I find I use regularly. It's still a work in progress, and by no means complete.

## SaaS Platforms
* [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) - Logging, reporting and monitoring.
* [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) - Manage and ship releases to your environments.
* [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) - Scaleable, indexed document store.

## Docker Images
* [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) - Nifty databases.
* [Seq](https://hub.docker.com/r/datalust/seq/) - Local log sink with simple dashboard.

## Dev Tools
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - My main IDE for .net.
* [VS Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The other IDE.
* [NCrunch](https://www.ncrunch.net/) - Because tests while you type rocks.
