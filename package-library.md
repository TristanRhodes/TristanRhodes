## Package Library

This is a list of software, packages and images that I find I use regularly. It's still a work in progress, and by no means complete.

## Dev Environment
* [NCrunch](https://www.ncrunch.net/) - Because tests while you type rocks.
* [Specflow](https://specflow.org/) - BDD testing framework.

## DotNet Packages

### Testing
* [XUnit](https://xunit.net/) - Runs unit tests.
* [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq) - Create fakes, mocks and stubs.
* [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/introduction) - Assert... fluently.
* [Simmy](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Simmy) - Chaos Behavior based off Polly, throw errors and add latency.

### Resilience

### Text
* [Sprache](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache) - Scannerless parsing library for turning text into objects.

### Observability

* [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) - Composeable, observable streams.

### Time and Space
